<p id="about"> as a self-taught dancer and freestyler, I've always been anxious to move and grow not only as a choreographer, but as a student and human being as well. i'm interested in developing my skills as a mathematician, diving into the creative processes of web design, and continuing to learn more about the real-world applications of statistics and data science. as a mental health advocate that has worked with groups such mental health america and the asian mental health collective, my life-long dream is to empower others to create vibrant and inclusive spaces for themselves. </p>
